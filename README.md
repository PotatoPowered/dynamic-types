## Description
The *dynamic-types* repository will be more of a library that allows other Potato Powered applications to dynamically lookup and identify entities
based on their table name. This is helpful for being able to write standardized code for things like comments/likes and other similar functionality.

In general this will be used to link one entity to a broad variety of other entities on the fly.
